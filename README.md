# About the Project: Reusable Components

This project capitalizes on the strengths of React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, presenting a comprehensive collection of reusable components. With components like accordions, modals, buttons, sortable tables, and normal tables, we offer a diverse range of building blocks to enhance user interfaces.

Through the utilization of navigation context, reusable link components, and providers, our project enables seamless navigation between different sections without the need for page refreshes. Leveraging the power of route components and the navigation hook, users can effortlessly move between links, navigate back and forth without refreshing the page, and achieve a smooth browsing experience without unnecessary network requests.

Furthermore, we have incorporated a custom hook for the sortable component, providing intuitive sorting functionality with minimal implementation effort.

Additionally, our project features a Counter component that leverages the action and reducer features in React. With four actions and a reducer, the Counter component offers a robust foundation for managing state updates and triggering specific behaviors.

By combining the benefits of React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, our project delivers a highly reusable and efficient solution for building interactive user interfaces with seamless navigation, sorting capabilities, and state management.
